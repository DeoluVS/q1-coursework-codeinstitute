                    <h4>Early Life and Musical Roots MC</h4>
                    <p>From as young as three years old, Shola exhibited a natural gift for performance—dancing with her eyes closed and bringing joy to those around her. After becoming born again in Nigeria in 1987, she moved to the UK in 1988 and quickly began ministering in the choir under Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo's ministry.

            <h4>Ministry and Musical Career</h4>
            <p>
                Shola is a celebrated worship leader, singer-songwriter, and recording artist, renowned for leading many into the presence of her “story changer” — a heartfelt way she refers to God. She has been instrumental in crafting worship music, contributing to notable choir recordings such as “Sons of the Great King”, “We Give You Praise”, and “You're My Everything”.
            </p>
            <h4>Expanding Impact</h4>
            <p>Beyond music, Shola wears many hats—she's a weight loss and fitness coach, entrepreneur, actress, event speaker, and multi-award winner (honoured by AGMA, ADMA, Beffta, Praisetek, Woman of Worship, Kingdom Radio Merit Awards, among others). Her passion extends into training others: she's authored a manual, <b>The Art of True Worship</b>, and regularly 
                leads workshops and seminars tailored for worship leaders, choir members, and music ministers.</p>    
            <h4>National and International Ministry</h4>
            <p>Shola's ministry has taken her across the UK and around the world—including places like Ireland, Geneva, and Borås (Sweden)—where she's led worship and taught at various Christian platforms.
            </p>
            <h4>Faith, Family and Community</h4>
            <p>Together with her husband, Minister Victor-Sajowa, Shola co-hosts the <b>“Art of True Worship”</b>—a conference designed to inspire and equip worship teams, choirs, and leaders. As a pastor's wife based in Tooting, she serves alongside her husband at a KICC (Kingdom In Christ Church) chapel. Their union is blessed with three children, and she is deeply committed to seeing lives transformed and destinies fulfilled.
            </p>
            <h4>Creative Highlights</h4>
            <p>One of Shola's notable releases is the song <b>"Author of Life"</b>—a vibrant worship piece filled with adoration and unwavering faith, accompanied by a music video that embodies her passion for praising God unreservedly</p>
